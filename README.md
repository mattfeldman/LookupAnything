**Lookup Anything** is a [Stardew Valley](http://stardewvalley.net/) mod that shows live info about
whatever's under your cursor when you press `F1`. Learn a villager's favourite gifts, when a crop
will be ready to harvest, how long a fence will last, why your farm animals are unhappy, and more.

## Installation
1. Install [SMAPI](https://github.com/ClxS/SMAPI) (0.40+).
2. [Install this mod from Nexus mods](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/541/).
3. Run the game using SMAPI.

## Usage
Just point your cursor at something and press `F1`. The mod will show live info about that object.

## Examples
Here are some representative screenshots (layout and values will change dynamically as needed).

## Configuration
The mod will work fine out of the box, but you can tweak its settings by editing the `config.json`
file if you want. These are the available settings:

| setting           | what it affects
| ----------------- | -------------------
| `Keyboard`        | Set keyboard bindings. The default values are `F1` to lookup, and `Up`/`Down` to scroll. See [valid keys](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.xna.framework.input.keys.aspx).
| `Controller`      | Set controller bindings. No buttons configured by default. See [valid buttons](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.xna.framework.input.buttons.aspx).
| `CheckForUpdates` | Default `true`. Whether the mod should check for a newer version when you load the game. If a new version is available, you'll [see a small message at the bottom of the screen for a few seconds](screenshots/new-version-message.png). This doesn't affect the load time even if your connection is offline or slow, because it happens in the background. |
| `HideOnKeyUp`     | Default `false`. If enabled, the lookup window will be shown while you hold `F1` and disappear when you release it.

## Compiling the mod
[Installing a stable release from Nexus Mods](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/541/) is
recommended. This section covers a less common scenario where you need to compile the mod from
source.

1. Edit `LookupAnything.csproj` and set the `<GamePath>` property to your Stardew Valley directory
   path.
2. *Linux/Mac only:* change the target framework to .NET 4.0 for compatibility with SMAPI on those
   platforms. (No code changes are required; the code is compatible with either framework.)

Launching the project will then compile the code, package it into the mod directory, and start the
game.

Useful tools when working on this mod:
* [dotPeek](https://www.jetbrains.com/decompiler/) to decompile the game into a Visual Studio
  project.
* [ReSharper](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/) to analyse the game code (e.g. find usages).
* [XNB Extract](http://community.playstarbound.com/threads/modding-guides-and-general-modding-discussion-redux.109131/)
  to extract the game's assets and data.
